# AI/ML Developer Internship - ShadowFox

This repository showcases the work done during my AI/ML internship at **ShadowFox**, where I contributed to machine learning projects involving **Boston House Price Prediction** and **Car Price Prediction**, both using **Linear Regression**.

## Projects

### 1. Boston House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

In this project, I used the famous **Boston Housing dataset** to predict house prices in Boston using **Linear Regression**. The goal was to build a model that could predict the price of a house based on features such as the number of rooms, location, crime rate, and other socioeconomic factors.

#### Key Steps:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.
- Model training: Trained a Linear Regression model on the processed dataset.
- Model evaluation: Assessed performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**.

#### Results:
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **R² Score**: 0.85
- **MSE**: 23.78

### 2. Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project involved predicting the selling price of cars using features such as fuel type, kilometers driven, number of previous owners, and more. A **Linear Regression** model was used to estimate the price of a car based on these attributes.

#### Key Steps:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the car dataset by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
- Model training: Trained a Linear Regression model to predict car prices.
- Model evaluation: Evaluated the model’s performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**.

#### Results:
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **R² Score**: 0.85
- **MSE**: 3.48
