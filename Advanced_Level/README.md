# GPT-2 Text Generation and NLP Exploration

This project explores the capabilities of the GPT-2 Language Model for text generation and other natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Using the pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library, this notebook demonstrates how to implement and evaluate the model's ability to generate creative and coherent text based on various prompts.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore GPT-2, a state-of-the-art language model for NLP tasks, focusing on its text generation capabilities. By experimenting with various types of prompts, we analyze its performance in terms of:
- **Contextual understanding**
- **Creativity in text generation**
- **Adaptability to diverse domains**

This project provides both the implementation of GPT-2 for text generation and visualizations to help understand the model's behavior.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `transformers`: For loading and interacting with the GPT-2 model.
- `torch`: For the deep learning framework used by GPT-2.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualizing the results.

You can install these libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install transformers torch matplotlib
