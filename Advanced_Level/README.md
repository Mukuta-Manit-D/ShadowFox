# GPT-2 Text Generation and NLP Exploration

This project explores the capabilities of the GPT-2 Language Model for text generation and other natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Using the pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library, this notebook demonstrates how to implement and evaluate the model's ability to generate creative and coherent text based on various prompts.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore GPT-2, a state-of-the-art language model for NLP tasks, focusing on its text generation capabilities. By experimenting with various types of prompts, we analyze its performance in terms of:
- **Contextual understanding**
- **Creativity in text generation**
- **Adaptability to diverse domains**

This project provides both the implementation of GPT-2 for text generation and visualizations to help understand the model's behavior.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `transformers`: For loading and interacting with the GPT-2 model.
- `torch`: For the deep learning framework used by GPT-2.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualizing the results.

You can install these libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install transformers torch matplotlib
```
## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt2-text-generation.git
cd gpt2-text-generation
```

## Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start a Jupyter Notebook to explore the model:
```bash
Language_Model.ipynb
```
## Usage
### 1. Load GPT-2 Model and Tokenizer
The notebook loads the pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer from Hugging Face, which is used to convert text into a format the model understands and vice versa.

### 2. Text Generation
Provide a text prompt, and the model generates text based on it. The function generate_text is used to generate text of a specified length.

Example:
```bash
prompt = "The future of artificial intelligence is"
generated_text = generate_text(prompt, max_length=100)
print(generated_text)
```

### 3. Performance Evaluation
Evaluate the model on various types of prompts:

* Simple statements
* Creative writing prompts
* Ambiguous or complex inputs.

## 4. Visualization
Visualize the probability distribution of the next word prediction based on a given prompt. This helps to understand the modelâ€™s decision-making process.
```bash
plot_next_word_probabilities("The impact of AI on healthcare is")
```
## Performance Evaluation
The performance evaluation is conducted through different types of prompts:

* Contextual Understanding: Test how well the model generates text based on complex and long input sequences.
* Creativity: Evaluate the creativity of the model when generating text based on prompts designed to encourage imaginative responses.
* Adaptability: Observe how well the model performs with prompts from various domains such as technology, healthcare, or storytelling.

## Research Questions and Objectives
The primary research questions explored in this project include:

* How well does GPT-2 understand and maintain context in long sequences of text?
* How creative is the model when tasked with generating original content?
* How well can the model adapt to domain-specific or ambiguous input prompts?

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates GPT-2's capabilities in NLP, especially in text generation tasks. While GPT-2 produces coherent and creative text for many types of prompts, it also faces challenges in maintaining context over longer texts and ensuring coherence in more technical or specific domains.

## Future Improvements:
Fine-tuning the model on domain-specific datasets for more targeted tasks.
Experimenting with newer models like GPT-3 or T5 for improved results.
