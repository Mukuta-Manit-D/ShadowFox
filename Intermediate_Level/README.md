# Car Selling Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the selling price of cars based on several features, including fuel type, years of service, showroom price, number of previous owners, kilometers driven, seller type (dealer/individual), and transmission type (manual/automatic). The model is built using machine learning techniques and evaluated for performance.

## Project Overview

The goal is to predict the selling price of used cars from the dataset based on features like fuel type, year of purchase, kilometers driven, and others. The model trained is a **Linear Regression** model that predicts the car selling price as a continuous variable.

### Features:
- **Car_Name**: The name of the car (categorical).
- **Year**: The year the car was bought (numerical).
- **Selling_Price**: The selling price of the car (target variable).
- **Present_Price**: The current price of the car from the showroom.
- **Kms_Driven**: The number of kilometers driven by the car.
- **Fuel_Type**: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, or CNG).
- **Seller_Type**: Whether the seller is a dealer or an individual.
- **Transmission**: The type of transmission (Manual or Automatic).
- **Owner**: The number of previous owners.
